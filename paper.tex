\begin{abstract}

Little kids use computers all the time.
The phone is the new pacifier; the iPad is the new slate and chalk.
Increasingly early in their schooling, kids also learn how to code.
We must teach them formal methods before all else.

Over four half-hour sessions, I taught a class of first-graders enough computer science to understand and appreciate the Ariane 5 space shuttle disaster.
Here's how.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

My time at Beverly J Martin Elementary School was facilitated by Cornell University's \textsc{grasshopr} program, a volunteer organization that pairs graduate students with K-12 teachers so they can share their research with curious students.
This is hard, important, rewarding work, and you are superstars for making it happen every year.

An enormous thank you to Ms Lisa Zdan, her teaching aides, and of course her first-graders.
