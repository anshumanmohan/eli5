\begin{abstract}

Little kids use computers all the time.
The phone is the new pacifier; the iPad is the new slate and chalk.
Increasingly early in their schooling, kids also learn how to code.
We must teach them formal methods before all else.

Over four half-hour sessions, I taught a class of first-graders enough computer science to understand and appreciate the Ariane 5 space shuttle disaster.
Here's how.

\section*{Lesson 1: A tale of two hungry cities}

I went into class with eight little handmade flags, each colored pink on one side and white on the other.
We split the class into two groups, standing in huddles on opposite ends of the room.
I handed each group one flag and explained the game:

``You are two cities on hills, and you have a zipline that carries food between you.
Occasionally you'd like to order something to eat from the other city, but the city is rather far and you can only communicate using your flags.
A flag is either pink or white, and you can order either a burger or spaghetti.''

I allowed them one meeting to come up with a plan, with a warning that the cities were very far apart: they wouldn't be able to hear each other, or see anything but their flags, once the meeting was over.

In just a few minutes, they had it figured out: pink meant a burger, white meant spaghetti.

% P | burger
% W | spaghetti

I sneaked up to one city and whispered, ``Can you order me a burger, please?'', and the students delivered.
I ran to the other city and got them to order me another burger and some spaghetti. Delicious.
Then I went to the first city and requested that they order me a hot dog.

Pandemonium ensued.
I was accused of being a very naughty man.

A student proposed that \emph{no} flag could mean a hot dog, but I steered them away from that: ``Well some days you may want to order nothing at all; reserve no flag for that.''

Another proposed balancing the flag between pink and white, or swapping quickly between pink and white; I steered them clear of these too.
After a minute I offered each city a second flag, and they had an answer right away.
The old rules would remain, and _any_ two flags would mean hot dog.

% P | burger
% W | spaghetti
% PP,PW,WP,WW | hot dog

This made me a little nervous, since it was not part of the plan, but things worked themselves out when I asked them to please order Ms Zdan a pizza.
A precocious student pointed out that they actually had room for a \emph{fifth} menu item.

% P | burger
% W | spaghetti
% PP | hot dog
% WW | pizza
% PW, WP | ice cream

``Well this is going great, but I just realized something.
What if the other city confuses the pizza order with just a huge order of spaghetti?
Or ice cream with a burger that is chopped up and mixed into spaghetti?

My time at Beverly J Martin Elementary School was facilitated by Cornell University's \textsc{grasshopr} program, a volunteer organization that pairs graduate students with K-12 teachers so they can share their research with curious students.
This is hard, important, rewarding work, and you are superstars for making it happen every year.

An enormous thank you to Ms Lisa Zdan, her teaching aides A and B, and of course her students.
