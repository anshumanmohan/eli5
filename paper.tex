\begin{abstract}

Little kids use computers all the time.
The phone is the new pacifier; the iPad is the new slate and chalk.
Increasingly early in their schooling, kids also learn how to code.
We must scare them straight by teaching them formal methods before all else.

Over four half-hour sessions, I taught a class of first-graders enough computer science to understand and appreciate the Ariane 5 space shuttle disaster.
Here's how.

\section*{Lesson 1: A tale of two hungry cities}

I went into class with eight pieces of card, each colored red on one side and blue on the other.
I split the class into two groups, standing in huddles on opposite ends of the room.
I handed each group one card and explained the game:

``You are two cities on hills, and you have a zipline that carries food between you.
Occasionally you'd like to order something to eat from the other city, but the city is rather far and you can only communicate using your cards.
A card is either red or blue, and you can order either a burger or spaghetti.''

I allowed them one meeting to come up with a plan, and they quickly had a plan: red would mean a burger, and blue spaghetti.

\begin{table}[h]\sffamily
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Signal & Order \\
  \midrule
  R & burger \\
  B & spaghetti \\
  \end{tabular}
  % \caption{Iteration 1.}%
\end{table}

I sneaked up to one city and whispered, ``Can you order me a burger, please?'', and the students delivered.
I ran to the other city and got them to order me another burger and some spaghetti. Delicious.
Then I went to the first city and requested that they order me a hot dog.

Pandemonium.
I was accused of being a naughty man.

A student proposed that \emph{no card} could mean a hot dog, but I steered them away from that: ``Well some days you may want to order nothing at all; reserve no card for that.''

Another proposed balancing the card between red and blue, or swapping quickly between red and blue; I steered them clear of these too.
After a minute I offered each city a second card, and they had an answer right away.
The old rules would remain, and \emph{any} two cards would mean hot dog.

\begin{table}[h]\sffamily
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Signal & Order \\
  \midrule
  R & burger \\
  B & spaghetti \\
  RR, BB, BR, RB & hot dog
  \end{tabular}
  % \caption{Iteration 2.}%
\end{table}

This made me a little nervous, since it was not part of the plan, but I steered things along:
``Well this is great, but what if the other city confuses the hot dog order with just a double order, or a burger that is chopped up and mixed into spaghetti?''

They figured out the way to make me happy:

\begin{table}[h]\sffamily
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Signal & Order \\
  \midrule
  RR & burger \\
  BB & spaghetti \\
  RB, BR & hot dog
  \end{tabular}
  % \caption{Iteration 3.}%
\end{table}

They soon realized they could actually say four things:

\begin{table}[h]\sffamily
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  Signal & Order \\
  \midrule
  RR & burger \\
  BB & spaghetti \\
  RB & hot dog \\
  BR & pizza
  \end{tabular}
  % \caption{Iteration 4.}%
\end{table}

And of course, the finale: I handed them a third card, asked them to make the longest list they could, and left the room.
I returned to a menu of eight items.

We were out of time, but the students had enough fun that Ms Zdan requested that I leave the cards for them to play with until next week's lesson.
I left her with all eight cards, and a hint: ``You can make a list of $2^n$ items using $n$ cards.''

My time at Beverly J Martin Elementary School was facilitated by Cornell University's \textsc{grasshopr} program, a volunteer organization that pairs graduate students with K-12 teachers so they can share their research with curious students.
This is hard, important, rewarding work, and you are superstars for making it happen every year.

An enormous thank you to Ms Lisa Zdan, her teaching aides A and B, and of course her students.
